                    <p4>Hillsboro</p4>
                    <p>Hillsboro is a city in the U.S. state of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County.</br>
                        It
                        is
                        Situated in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area,
                        the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel, locally known as the Silicon
                        Forest.</br>
                        The population was 106,447 at the 2020 census,[4] making Hillsboro the fifth-most populous city
                        in Oregon.</br>
                        Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon
                        politician.</br>
                        Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy.</br>
                        A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four
                        decades later.</br>
                        These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by
                        1910 and about
                        5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s.</br>
